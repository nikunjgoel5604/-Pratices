🏷 Project Title 
AI Job Market & Skill Intelligence System

📄 Project Description
This project analyzes the AI job market using real-world job listing data to understand skill demand, salary trends, and the impact of AI adoption across industries. It combines Data Analytics, Machine Learning, NLP, and Business Intelligence to build a complete intelligent system that can predict salaries, clean and standardize job skills, recommend suitable job roles based on user skills, and visualize job market insights through interactive dashboards. The project simulates an industry-level end-to-end data science workflow using a single dataset.

❓ Why This Project
To gain hands-on experience in the complete data science lifecycle
To understand real job market trends in AI and Data Science
To practice EDA, Machine Learning, NLP, and Dashboarding in one project
To build a portfolio-grade project instead of small disconnected tasks
To prepare for internships, placements, and startup ideas
To demonstrate the ability to turn raw data into business insights and intelligent systems
This project shows that you can work not only as a Data Analyst but also as a Data Scientist and AI Engineer.
