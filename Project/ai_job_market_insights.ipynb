    "This project analyzes the AI job market using real-world job listing data to understand skill demand, salary trends, and the impact of AI adoption across industries. It combines Data Analytics, Machine Learning, NLP, and Business Intelligence to build a complete intelligent system that can predict salaries, clean and standardize job skills, recommend suitable job roles based on user skills, and visualize job market insights through interactive dashboards. The project simulates an industry-level end-to-end data science workflow using a single dataset."
